- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChristianKuehnert
- 👀 I’m interested in physics, data science, socio-economics, theatre and many other things. My main professional interest is the connection between scientific modelling and data science. E.g., I use both the theoretical relations of a complex system together with data science approaches to get more accurate models than with each discipline alone.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects
- 📫 How to reach me: Please just send me a mail to ChristianKuehnert@gmx.de
